# Textual-Emotion-Recognition
The project aims to develop a Machine Learning Model that can classify English communications based on their emotional content by enhancing NLP's understanding of emotional contexts in communication. Important components include investigating concepts like language nomenclature and emotion recognition, investigating methodologies, and implementing processes like data collection, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. This work contributes to emotion-aware AI systems and stimulates future research in multilingual emotion recognition  by analyzing and classifying emotions in text. It aims to address challenges in emotion detection and support applications like social media sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, and customer feedback analysis.

The tasks to be undertaken in this project include:
1. Conducting a literature review on Textual Emotion Recognition to gain insights into best practices and methodologies.
2. Gather a dataset of English text messages labeled with emotional categories.
3.  Performing Exploratory Data Analysis, focusing on aspects such as sentence lengths, commonly used stop words, and creating Word Cloud visualizations for each emotional category.
4.  Developing three distinct Machine Learning models tailored for the datasets.
5.   Experiment with deep learning models, for emotion recognition..
6.   Conduct a comparative analysis of the model performance across different datasets.

By undertaking these tasks, the project aims to explore the challenges associated with emotion detection in text, develop robust Machine Learning models for emotion classification, and assess the performance of these models. Through this comprehensive approach, the project seeks to contribute valuable insights to the field of NLP and emotion analysis, addressing the complexities of understanding and interpreting emotions in English text. The findings will help advance the development of emotion-aware applications and provide a foundation for future research in multilingual emotion recognition.
